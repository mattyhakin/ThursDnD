Chapter 0

12 months have passed since the slaying of the young white dragon, Cryovain a peace has fallen over Phadalin and the Sword Coast. The adventurers who slayed the dragon returned to the town they had called home to help the rebuilding process.
 
As time goes on and the terror the dragon brought becomes a distance memory, the adventurers go there separate ways. Baz’hak slips away one night leaving no trace that he was ever there, Manon taking the knowledge she gained during her time with the party and going back to her studies in the remote Sword Mountains and Orsik returning to his home lands. 
 
This left Guy Thundercaller leading the rebuilding effort of Phadalin, helping to rebuild the town to its former glories and beyond. He over saw the installation of a town master - Cedric  Broadshield, a former acquittance from Neverwinte, he gained the nickname “Iron Quill” unyielding determination to see justice served, whether through careful diplomacy or clever legal maneuvering. After exposing corruption in a noble house in Neverwinter he moved to Phadlin to start again with his daughters Mira and Elara.
 
Bardlebie also remained in Phandalin telling tales and singing songs from his time as an adventure and how he single handly killed a dragon to dozen of adoring fans. As time goes on he sang less and took up other pursuits attuned to his new found fame.
 
An unlikely couple of creatures head to Phadalin in the form of Kalidor, a naive elf who is entering the world for the first time after a shelled upbringing and Barzul. Who is a Gnome with a very dark soul. Both drawn to Phadalin through meetings with Orsil and given instruction to find the rest of the party. Stumbling upon each other in a graveyard - seeing light within Barzul, Kalidor looks to help his new found friend see the light but unbeknownst to him it is all a ruse by Kalidor to use Barzul for his own devices.
Another new face comes to Phadlin during the rebuilding of the town, a young woman with a knack for tinkering and invention, who is looking for a new place to call home. She has a something in her past that she is trying to escape from but will not let anyone get close enough to find out what happened, she see her past as a weakness that she wants to escape from and look to try right some form of wrongs. She enters a village that opens strangers with open arms but she doesn’t seem to keen to be in its embrace.
 
It seemed like another evening in Phaaldin, the towns folks had returned home from a hard days work in the fields and rebuilding the final houses in town to return. People where enjoying the evening at the Stonehill Inn, our party of adventurers are drawn there - Guy to speak to the Iron Quill about his time coming to an end in Phadlin, Kalidor and Barzul carrying on their quest to find the adventures and Bardlebie was getting to know one of the new members of town as Ash enters the bar....

Ash enters the Inn and moves towards the bar, moving with easy between the patrons enjoying a well-earned drink after a hard day’s work.

In one corner of the bar, nursing their drinks sits Barzul and Kalidor discussing their next moves until Barzul feels a presence in the bar with an aurora of death that he finds irresistible, he scans the Inn looking for the source of this power.

Guy Thundercaller sits in another corner of the Inn, speaking with the Ironquill, the new town master of Phandalin discuss his plans to leave town now the rebuilding is almost complete, feeling his quest has been completed and knowing others on the Sword Coast needs his help. The Ironquill seems to become distracted and focused on a door on the first floor and the young girl who just disappeared through it.

Ash is getting closer to the bar, being surrounded by people makes her feel uncomfortable, she wants to be far from here far from people. She hears someone talking to her to her left, she cant remember what he said but she understood its tone. The voice says something again and its owner layers a hand on Ash’s shoulder and tries to pull her in close.

Bardlebie is loving life – the fame, the gold and the women that come with being one of the adventures who rid the land of Dragon. This evening, he is making the acquaintance of Elara, one of the new sisters who have moved into town. Her farther is someone of importance but Bardlebie cant remember who he is but at this moment in time he does not care…

The Iroquill stands and begins to walk towards the stairs up to the first-floor door he took so much interest in. Guy stands to follow; he takes 2 steps but then stops and looks to the bar.

It all happens in a flash, the hand on her shoulder, the cry of the man as she broke his wrist. The threats of the mans friends and other patrons at the bar, more hands and fists in coming in her direction. Ash’s world turns into a blur. 
Kalidor tries to bring Barzul attention back to their conversation but then like a beacon Kalidor found what he was looking for, he grabbed his friend’s wrist and pulled them into the fray at the bar.

There was banging at the door, but Bardlebie didn’t care, he was wondering if he had ordered food and drink, and it was one of the bar staff bringing it up. He could hear a voice from behind the door, but he had more pressing matters to attend to, that was until the door was kicked in. A man stood there shouting at him and his new friend, she screamed in recognition. A back and forth between them begin and that’s when Bardlebie noticed the knife in the man’s hand. His instincts kicked in, he slided from the bed to the floor, grabbing his cloths, coin, bag and lute. He sprinted to the door side stepping the man while he sure he heard his company mentioned being in love.

Guy looked over at the fight going on at the bar, more and more of the patrons where joining. He was getting ready to sit down when he heard the crashing of a door and a heated argument taking place then he saw a very naked shape dart from the door and then leap from the balcony into the crowd below, at this moment Guy sighed, finished his drink and waded into the fray.
