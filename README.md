Chapter 0

12 months have passed since the slaying of the young white dragon, Cryovain a peace has fallen over Phadalin and the Sword Coast. The adventurers who slayed the dragon returned to the town they had called home to help the rebuilding process.
 
As time goes on and the terror the dragon brought becomes a distance memory, the adventurers go there separate ways. Baz’hak slips away one night leaving no trace that he was ever there, Manon taking the knowledge she gained during her time with the party and going back to her studies in the remote Sword Mountains and Orsik returning to his home lands.

This left Guy Thundercaller leading the rebuilding effort of Phadalin, helping to rebuild the town to its former glories and beyond. He over saw the installation of a town master - Cedric  Broadshield, a former acquittance from Neverwinte, he gained the nickname “Iron Quill” unyielding determination to see justice served, whether through careful diplomacy or clever legal maneuvering. After exposing corruption in a noble house in Neverwinter he moved to Phadlin to start again with his daughters Mira and Elara.
 
Bardlebie also remained in Phandalin telling tales and singing songs from his time as an adventure and how he single handly killed a dragon to dozen of adoring fans. As time goes on he sang less and took up other pursuits attuned to his new found fame.
 
An unlikely couple of creatures head to Phadalin in the form of Kalidor, a naive elf who is entering the world for the first time after a shelled upbringing and Barzul. Who is a Gnome with a very dark soul. Both drawn to Phadalin through meetings with Orsil and given instruction to find the rest of the party. Stumbling upon each other in a graveyard - seeing light within Barzul, Kalidor looks to help his new found friend see the light but unbeknownst to him it is all a ruse by Kalidor to use Barzul for his own devices.

Another new face comes to Phadlin during the rebuilding of the town, a young woman with a knack for tinkering and invention, who is looking for a new place to call home. She has a something in her past that she is trying to escape from but will not let anyone get close enough to find out what happened, she see her past as a weakness that she wants to escape from and look to try right some form of wrongs. She enters a village that opens strangers with open arms but she doesn’t seem to keen to be in its embrace.
 
It seemed like another evening in Phaaldin, the towns folks had returned home from a hard days work in the fields and rebuilding the final houses in town to return. People where enjoying the evening at the Stonehill Inn, our party of adventurers are drawn there - Guy to speak to the Iron Quill about his time coming to an end in Phadlin, Kalidor and Barzul carrying on their quest to find the adventures and Bardlebie was getting to know one of the new members of town as Ash enters the bar....

Ash enters the Inn and moves towards the bar, moving with easy between the patrons enjoying a well-earned drink after a hard day’s work.

In one corner of the bar, nursing their drinks sits Barzul and Kalidor discussing their next moves until Barzul feels a presence in the bar with an aurora of death that he finds irresistible, he scans the Inn looking for the source of this power.

Guy Thundercaller sits in another corner of the Inn, speaking with the Ironquill, the new town master of Phandalin discuss his plans to leave town now the rebuilding is almost complete, feeling his quest has been completed and knowing others on the Sword Coast needs his help. The Ironquill seems to become distracted and focused on a door on the first floor and the young girl who just disappeared through it.

Ash is getting closer to the bar, being surrounded by people makes her feel uncomfortable, she wants to be far from here far from people. She hears someone talking to her to her left, she cant remember what he said but she understood its tone. The voice says something again and its owner layers a hand on Ash’s shoulder and tries to pull her in close.

Bardlebie is loving life – the fame, the gold and the women that come with being one of the adventures who rid the land of Dragon. This evening, he is making the acquaintance of Elara, one of the new sisters who have moved into town. Her farther is someone of importance but Bardlebie cant remember who he is but at this moment in time he does not care…

The Iroquill stands and begins to walk towards the stairs up to the first-floor door he took so much interest in. Guy stands to follow; he takes 2 steps but then stops and looks to the bar.

It all happens in a flash, the hand on her shoulder, the cry of the man as she broke his wrist. The threats of the mans friends and other patrons at the bar, more hands and fists in coming in her direction. Ash’s world turns into a blur. 
Kalidor tries to bring Barzul attention back to their conversation but then like a beacon Kalidor found what he was looking for, he grabbed his friend’s wrist and pulled them into the fray at the bar.

Guy looked over at the fight going on at the bar, more and more of the patrons where joining. He was getting ready to sit down when he heard the crashing of a door and a heated argument taking place then he saw a very naked shape dart from the door and then leap from the balcony into the crowd below, at this moment Guy sighed, finished his drink and waded into the fray.

There was banging at the door, but Bardlebie didn’t care, he was wondering if he had ordered food and drink, and it was one of the bar staff bringing it up. He could hear a voice from behind the door, but he had more pressing matters to attend to, that was until the door was kicked in. A man stood there shouting at him and his new friend, she screamed in recognition. A back and forth between them begin and that’s when Bardlebie noticed the knife in the man’s hand. His instincts kicked in, he slided from the bed to the floor, grabbing his cloths, coin, bag and lute. He sprinted to the door side stepping the man while he sure he heard his company mentioned being in love.

<h4><em>Chapter I: The Siege at Wayside</em></h4>

The tale picks up not with triumph, but with flight. The embers of a duel still smoldered in Stonehill Inn as the adventurers made their escape beneath a dusk-dark sky. With Guy at their side and tension hot on their heels, they raced west along the road—toward the High Reed, toward uncertainty. They were not alone for long.

From behind, half-dressed and grinning like a jester caught in a brothel, Bardlebie joined the retreat—trailing behind him a cacophony of curses from Cedric “Ironquill” Broadshield and his guards. They ran until the stars blinked to life above them, until their breath came sharp and clouded.

</p>

And there—at the crossroads of the High Road and Triboar Trail—they found sanctuary under siege.

The Wayside Inn, a once-cheerful roadside retreat, now stood barricaded and battered. Its lanterns flickered behind boarded windows. Shapes moved in the gloom—undead, clawing and groaning, pawing at the inn’s defenses with relentless hunger.

With a wordless nod, the adventurers drew steel and leapt into the fray.

None fought harder than Kalidor, whose wrath burned like a comet. Blades flashed, arrows sang, and spells crackled as the party cut through the shambling dead. But the mire held more in store.

From the trees came a new terror—wraiths, spectral and wrathful, drawn by the slaughter. The party hesitated, but fate chose for them: a single crossbow bolt flew from the inn’s upper window and struck one of the wraiths squarely in the neck. With that, the fight was joined.

The spectral foes fell quickly, undone by song, fire, and holy might.

At last, the doors of the Wayside Inn opened, and grateful faces peered out. The adventurers were welcomed not only with cheers—but with drink.

Inside, the party met Martisha, the innkeeper. On the surface, she seemed warm—almost too warm. Her books were suspiciously tidy, her ledger oddly coded. Something in her behavior whispered secrets. While she evaded questions about the undead, her companion, Turbin the Bard, proved more forthcoming.

“There’s a dark wizard in these parts,” he whispered between sips of spiced wine. “Raising the dead. Testing the edges of something… ancient.”

Not all at the inn seemed glad to be rescued. But for now, the drinks were free, the fire was warm, and the beds—such as they were—offered some rest. Some took rooms. Others—more wild-hearted or paranoid—chose the stables.

Yet none truly slept easily, for the shadow behind the siege had yet to show its true face.

<h4><em>Chapter II: The Storm and the Sacrifice</em></h4>

Morning came with thunder on the horizon.

The party left the inn and resumed their road to Leilon, where the scent of salt and smoke mingled on the breeze. But before they could reach the safety of the rebuilt walls, they came upon a makeshift town gathering—a sea of tents and carts just shy of town.

The citizens had evacuated, driven out by warning cries from the guards. And there, in the center of it all, stood the iron voice of order: Grizzelda Copperwrought, known to all (though never to her face) as “The Growler.”

Beside her stood Sergeant Hazz Yorrum, looking as tired and crooked as an old fence post. Two other notable figures stood nearby:

• Merrygold Brightshine, priest of Lathander, sun-bright and frantic.

• Valdi Estapaar, half-elven fisher, stoic and weatherworn.

Together, they made up Leilon’s fledgling Town Council.

The Growler opened the meeting with her usual fire, chastising panicked workers and stonecutters. But murmurs rose from the crowd:

• A stonemason spoke of strange lights on the water.

• Another recalled shouting from fishing boats.

• Then came a cry from the back: “The children! Smithwell and Burnice! They’re gone!”

The crowd turned chaotic. Yorrum barked orders. Merrygold begged for action. The Growler demanded calm.

It was then that Talos struck.

Lightning cracked, and cultists emerged from the brush. The crowd screamed and scattered. Acolytes of Lathander ushered terrified children to safety while adults bolted for the woods. Yorrum fled faster than most, tripping over his own shield.

But the adventurers stood tall—and struck back. Lightning and blade met dark prayers as the cultists fell beneath a storm not of Talos, but of resolve.

In the stillness that followed, they pressed deeper into the town.

There, before the fishery, stood a horned woman in robes soaked with seawater. Her name was Nixoxious, a kraken priest, flanked by berserkers. They chanted in a language not meant for land-dwellers, calling to dark things beneath the waves.

Kalidor and Barzul hesitated, momentarily overwhelmed by the sight of a summoned Water Elemental, but soon rallied to join their friends.

The battle raged through the alleyways and over rooftops:

• Ash vaulted a wall and tackled a berserker mid-sprint.

• The kraken priest unleashed a thunderous blast, nearly killing Barzul.

• Kalidor retaliated with a crackling cone of lightning, scorching foes and searing the priest.

• Water weirds emerged from the marshy ground.

• Barzul, with death’s cold fingers, raised the fallen to fight on his side.

Then, in a flash of water and fury, Kalidor was struck down—bloodied and gasping. But Barzul knelt beside him, and the light of necrotic magic stitched life back into his veins.

Ash, in a final act of brute courage, punched the elemental to death, fist through brine and bone.

</p>

As they paused to catch their breath, a sound came from within a boarded-up house.

Inside, they found Smithwell and Burnice, shaking but safe. Ash won their trust the best way he knew how: with chocolate biscuits.

Through teary eyes, the children spoke of their fisherfolk parents, who had been taken across the marsh—guarded, they said, by armored men with cruel voices. A ritual, they whispered. A sacrifice to Talos.

The party waited for the storm to pass. Then they set out.

Through blackened waters and twisted reeds, they fought again—more water weirds, more cultists. At last, they reached the island where the fishers and soldiers were bound.

And they freed them all.

When the party returned to Leilon, the Growler awaited.

“You’ve done more than most armies would,” she said.

“Take this. You’ve earned it.”

And with that, she handed them the deed to a home of their own—a place within the walls of Leilon, forged not from gold, but from heroism, grit, and no small amount of fireball.
