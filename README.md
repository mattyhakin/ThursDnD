# 📜 Echoes of Leilon

_“In the shadow of thunder and time, the stones of Leilon remember more than we do—echoes of valor, betrayal, and the fragile hope that even ruins may rise again.”_

Welcome to the digital chronicle of our homebrew Dungeons & Dragons campaign, **Thursday Night D&D: Echoes of Leilon**. This site presents the story as a dusty tome, retold through chapters gathered by a fictional scholar from Candlekeep, complete with parchment textures, magical artifacts, and legendary deeds.
