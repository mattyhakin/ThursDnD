    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Echoes of Leilon</em></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>“In the shadow of thunder and time, the stones of Leilon remember more than we do—echoes of valor, betrayal, and the fragile hope that even ruins may rise again.”</em></strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Set down by Thaelen Morovyn of Candlekeep, these echoes of Leilon are pieced together from broken letters, tavern songs, and the memories of those who braved the storm.</em></p>

      <summary>Prologue — Return to Phandalin</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A year after Cryovain’s fall, the companions drift, Phandalin rebuilds, and new faces step from rumor into fate.</p>

      <p>Twelve months after the slaying of Cryovain, quiet settled on Phandalin and the Sword Coast. The dragon’s shadow faded to memory, and those who felled it set down their burdens—some for a time, some forever.</p>

      <p>Guy Thundercaller remained to guide the town’s rebirth, helping seat a new townmaster: <em>Cedric “Ironquill” Broadshield</em> of Neverwinter, a man whose quill carved justice as keenly as any blade. His daughters, Mira and Elara, made Phandalin their home.</p>

      </p>

      <p>Bardlebie lingered as well, trading steel for song, telling ever-expanding tales of dragons slain—sometimes single-handedly. New travelers threaded the roads: Kalidor, an elf fresh from a sheltered isle; and Barzul, a gnome shadowed by darker study. Fate knotted their paths in a graveyard’s hush.</p>

      <p>Another stranger arrived: Ash, a tinkerer with secrets and scars kept close. Phandalin welcomed her as it does all strays; she kept her distance, as strays often do.</p>

      <p>The Stonehill Inn’s lamps burned late that night. Words turned to shouts; a scuffle bloomed; a balcony door burst; and Guy, with the long-suffering sigh of a veteran, waded into trouble once more.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Chapter I — Siege at Wayside</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Fleeing Phandalin, the party reaches the Wayside Inn and breaks a siege of undead and wraiths, earning rest—and questions.</p>

      <p>Night found the company at the crossroads of the High Road and Triboar Trail, where the Wayside Inn stood barricaded and bruised. Undead clawed the shutters; wraiths drifted like torn banners of the grave. The party answered with steel, spell, and stubborn song.</p>

      </p>

      <p>The dead fell. Doors opened. Within, Martisha the innkeeper smiled too smoothly; Turbin the bard spoke more plainly—of a hidden mage testing old boundaries. Warm beds followed cold steel, but sleep sat lightly. Something in the shadows had yet to show its face.</p>

      <summary>Chapter II — The Storm and the Sacrifice</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Leilon’s council seeks help as Talos cultists strike. The party rescues townsfolk, defeats a kraken priest, and earns a home within the walls.</p>

      <p>Thunder crowned the morning as Leilon’s council—Grizzelda “the Growler,” Merrygold Brightshine, and Valdi Estapaar—strove to calm a frightened camp outside the town. Lightning cleaved the sky; Talos answered with blades and zeal.</p>

      <p>The party stood. Cultists fell. By the fishery, a kraken priestess called things from the deep; water elementals rose; Ash shattered one with raw will; Kalidor fell and rose again by Barzul’s dark grace. Children were found, parents freed, and the storm pushed back, if not broken.</p>

      <p>For deeds beyond measure, the Growler pressed a deed into their hands: a home of their own within Leilon.</p>

    <!-- CHAPTER III -->
    <details>
      <summary>Chapter III — Echoes of the Beacon</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> At the House of Thalivar, a possessed mage and an old journal reveal the Planar Beacon’s history; a spirit is set free.</p>

      <p>The tower loomed over Leilon like a held breath. Soldiers warned the party away; the mage Gallio Elibro muttered through sleepless nights. A Turmish ghost watched from the high window and vanished.</p>

      <p>Within, dust whispered. A stone golem woke angry and fell harder. Among its ruin lay Thalivar’s journal—ink of the present staining a century of silence. It spoke of the Planar Beacon, and of dreams that weren’t Gallio’s to dream.</p>

      <p align="center">

      </p>

      <p>Barzul found a rite of release. At the tower’s crown, the party broke the tether. Thalivar’s spirit bowed and unmade itself to light. Below, the ghostly watcher raised her sword in silent salute and walked into the mist.</p>

      <summary>Chapter IV — Of Stone and Scales</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In the Mere of Dead Men, the party rescues captives, forges peace with lizardfolk, and hunts rot trolls to seal the pact.</p>

      <p>Breltora Red-Eye sought help: Private Vester Jessup was missing near the Mere. The swamp opened its long jaw—yuan-ti scouts, a lizardfolk camp, and cages of soldiers and merchants. Words outran war; the prisoners were freed.</p>

      <p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/mattyhakin/ThursDnD/blob/main/docs/assets/030441a1864700c1de4555178970678a6ebea6715c2c90d79ffe6eff4961cb85.png?raw=true" width="240" height="320" alt="Lizardfolk pact">
      </p>

      <p>Subchief Hissain asked a price for lasting peace: three rot trolls. Slosh the render grinned; Gary the Giant Snail advanced like a damp bulwark; steel and sorcery burned corruption to ash. The camp slept safely for the first time in many nights.</p>

      <summary>Chapter V — The Bleating Road</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Hired to escort giant goats to Phandalin, the party survives ogres, scatters wyverns, and returns to find rival cults waiting.</p>

      <p>After their victory, Hissain’s people camped beyond Leilon while the party resupplied at Aubrey’s peculiar shop and answered the Growler’s call. Thaldrin Stonehoof hired them to guard eight giant goats to Phandalin. Fees were negotiated, drinks taken, dawn kept.</p>

      <p>In the woods, ogres came hungry. Kalidor roared as a lion; Bardlebie turned a brute with a smile; Barzul blighted; Ash and Guy cut clean. Later, wyverns raked the sky and panicked the herd, but the goats were gathered and the road held.</p>

      <p align="center">
        <img src="https://github.com/mattyhakin/ThursDnD/blob/main/docs/assets/44a0d975812b1ed268135e1c4de5d94e6b11e69c5c84b77cf92f82864472e481.png?raw=true" width="240" height="320" alt="Ogre clash">
      </p>

      <p>Phandalin’s outskirts welcomed and watched. A dwarven axe called <em>Stonebite</em> found a new hand. Then the trap was sprung: Talos zealots and Myrkul’s grim faithful closed like jaws. When silence fell, Velleen of Talos lay among the dead. On her, a leather case held rune-etched lenses and a simple note:</p>

      <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“The lenses show the secrets of the map.”</strong></p>

    <!-- CHAPTER VI -->
    <details>
      <summary>Chapter VI — Storm on the High Road</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A storm-broken caravan limps to Leilon. Northward, the party aids a knight, frees the Wayside Inn from Talos cultists, and ends a ritual—yet the storm endures.</p>

      <p>The tavern’s warmth awaited, but Leilon’s gate held trouble: a caravan returned soaked and shorn of goods, a horse slain by lightning, a tale of weather turned murderous near the Wayside Inn. The party set out into the teeth of it.</p>

      <p>A mile on, a knight named Emmalou fought three possessed suits of armor. Bardlebie blinked her from danger; courage returned her to the fray. Together they shattered the shells. She pointed them toward the inn and rode back to her duty.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>At the inn, the horror at the door was no zombie surge but living folk pinned by tridents. The party freed as many as they could and pushed inside. Talos cultists chanted; innocents knelt for the storm god’s altar. Steel and spell decided otherwise.</p>

      <p>From beneath a bed, a gnome apprentice, <em>Cray Onderquill</em>, whispered of Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and the kidnapping of Turbin the bard. The dark chorus drew the company below, where Teega, an Illuskan berserker, led a rite before a jagged idol of Talos. In the corner, Martisha Vinetalker, mistress of the Wayside, watched bound and unbowed.</p>

      <p>Teega fell; her zealots with her. Martisha was cut free and offered the party her enduring thanks. Yet when the chant died, the storm did not. Lightning still walked the clouds. The rite was broken—but not the source.</p>

    <!-- CHAPTER VII -->
    <details>
      <summary>Chapter VII — Shadows of the Woodruff Mansion</summary>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Pursuing Turbin’s captors north, the company shares old lives and new wounds. Barzul’s potion binds memory as vision. Mist parts to reveal the Woodruff Mansion.</p>

      <p>The storm-rattled Wayside faded as tracks pulled them north. Bardlebie’s mirth cooled at the thought of risking life for another bard. To break the road’s silence, the company traded truths: fame and folly, fathers and islands, and the grief Ash would not name.</p>

      <p>Barzul uncorked a potion, and story became shared vision—bright, terrible, binding. The magic stirred Ash’s buried anguish, the night her sister died, and the forest closed around their quiet.</p>

      <p>Fog thickened. Hours bled. Then the gloom drew back like a curtain—and there it stood: a broad, brooding house with towers like watchful helms.</p>

      <p><strong>The Woodruff Mansion awaited.</strong></p>
